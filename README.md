# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
**Binary trees** are a type of hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child
This repository contains the solutions to various tasks related to binary trees in the C programming language. The project focuses on understanding the details, advantages, and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. We have implemented different types of trees, including binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

## Requirements

- **General:**
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory.
  - Code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
  - No use of global variables is allowed.
  - Each file should have no more than 5 functions.
  - Standard library usage is allowed.
  - Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file named `binary_trees.h`.
  - Donâ€™t forget to push the header file.
  - All header files should be include guarded.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Basic Binary Tree
    ```c
    /**
     * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
     * @n: Integer stored in the node
     * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
     * @left: Pointer to the left child node
     * @right: Pointer to the right child node
     */
    struct binary_tree_s
    {
        int n;
        struct binary_tree_s *parent;
        struct binary_tree_s *left;
        struct binary_tree_s *right;
    };

    typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
    ```

  - Binary Search Tree
    ```c
    typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
    ```

  - AVL Tree
    ```c
    typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
    ```

  - Max Binary Heap
    ```c
    typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
    ```
